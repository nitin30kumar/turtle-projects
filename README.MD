# My turtle projects
> [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas.  The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the [__turtle__](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) and this is what gives the library its name.  In short, the Python [**turtle**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way.
