# My turtle projects
> "turtle" is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the _turtle_ and this is what gives the library its name. In short, the Python *turtle* library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way.
